This GitHub reflects the direction I am moving toward.

I spent many years as a professional football player. There you learn to see the whole field, understand patterns before they fully unfold, and recognize how small decisions affect the bigger picture. When I transitioned into IT, I realized I approach data the same way. First understand the structure. Then make decisions inside it.

I graduated as an ICT Engineer in December 2025. Since then, I have been building projects around SQL and Python, focusing on structure, validation, and clarity. What matters to me is not just getting a result, but making sure the logic behind it holds up.

Here you will find projects where:

- data is ingested and validated before analysis  
- structure is designed before queries are written  
- conclusions are based on understood context

## Projects

### Order-to-Insight

A data pipeline built with Python and DuckDB.  
The focus was on creating a clear flow from ingestion to modeling and reporting, with a clean and understandable structure.

### Olist Order Lifecycle Analytics

E-commerce data analysis using SQL.  
The work centers around order lifecycle modeling, payment validation, and understanding how events connect across the dataset.

I am still early in my technical career. I prefer building things carefully and correctly rather than quickly and loosely. This profile evolves as my skills grow.
